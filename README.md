# Convert-Book-To-Audio
This is a collections tool I made to join free services such as tesseract and fromtexttospeech.com to convert a scanned pdf to audio

This requires linux opperating system, i am unsure if it will work on any other operating system but it may be available on Mac.

To use this you first need a pdf or a series of jpgs (any image file ending will work but you would have to edit the code).

PREPERATION

In preperation you will need to install the following: 
pip (to install the python addons)
python: selenium,
pdftohtml, 
tesseract-ocr, 
glob,
and Python Image Library (PIL) 

I am assuming you already have glob and Python Image Library (PIL)
